# Beautiful Soup Demo

Two Python Notebook examples for using Beautiful Soup.

## Setup

To manually installing the packages, use the following commands.

```shell
pipenv install bs4
pipenv install requests
```

You can also install requirements using the provided `Pipfile`:

```shell
pipenv install
```

## x-rates

The first example showcases some basic Beautiful Soup functions. Play around with these functions in `xrates.ipynb`! The
code is also in `xrates.py` in case you prefer using a Python file, but it is intended to be used in a Python notebook.

## craigslist

The second example showcases a more involved example in getting specific, targeted data from Craigslist. Play around
with it in `craigslist.ipynb`. The code is also in `craigslist.py` in case you prefer using a Python file, but it is
intended to be used in a Python notebook.
